      <h2>A real Linux distribution on the phone</h2>
      <p>postmarketOS (<i>pmOS</i>), is a touch-optimized, pre-configured <a
              href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> that can be installed on smartphones and other mobile
        devices. The project is at very early stages of development and is not yet usable for most users.</p>

      <h2>We develop a <em>sustainable</em> mobile OS</h2>
      <p>It is 2017. Pick an average PC from 2007 and install a minimal Linux based operating system. You will be able
        to do basic computing tasks (eg. surfing the web, reading e-mails, listening to music, chatting) just like on an
        expensive modern PC. You will even get security updates, so your old computer is protected, just like a new one.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the current mobile landscape you get none of that. Even expensive phones only have few years of support. As time progresses,
        your phone becomes slower and slower, and the newest features will not work on it anymore. But postmarketOS builds upon a real
        Linux distribution, which has no reason to drop support for old devices at all and (assuming that you choose the right software)
        keeps the resource usage at a constant minimum instead of increasing it with every release. There's no reason to restrict
        features (such as full disk encryption) to newer devices either. We want to be able to use our devices until they break!

      <h2>Package and run anything you want</h2>
      <p>
        postmarketOS is developed in the spirit of regular Linux distributions,
        so there's no problem in having <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/62">multiple phone interfaces</a>
        (<a href="https://ubports.com">UBports</a>/featurephone with big numbers/plain shell...) and let the
        user choose. A lot of work already went into getting <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/wiki/Plasma-Mobile">
        KDE plasma mobile</a> running,
        it is getting closer every day!
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore postmarketOS will not impose arbitrary restrictions on you. Use the apps from any ecosystem you want (even desktop software).
        With Alpine's simple package format, you do not need more than a bit of
        Linux knowledge to <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/wiki/Creating-a-package">package your favorite programs</a>
        (assuming that they run on Linux already).

      <h2>We're evaluating our options for security holes in firmware</h2>
      <p>
        Mobile phones have dedicated chips for the cellular modem and wifi
        functionality. These chips only run with firmware files, which are little
        proprietary operating systems, that run alongside of
        your regular OS (such as Android or postmarketOS). In most cases they even have
        full access to the device's RAM, GPS and/or microphone.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with all proprietary software, we can not look at the source code to
        look for (security) bugs and
        <a href="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/12/coolreaper-revealed-backdoor-coolpad-android-devices/">backdoors</a>,
        and we can not update it when such security bugs become public. We are
        at the mercy of the device manufacturers to get updates, and they refuse to do so
        after the support of the device runs out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, practically every phone that is a few years old has such an
        issue - no matter which OS or ROM you install. Exploits are available
        <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1046#c2">in public</a>,
        so everyone with enough IT knowledge (or money to get IT experts)
        can turn these older phones into surveillance devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are well aware of the situation and
        <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Firmware">exploring our options</a>. One a side note,
        we are also interested in using the
        <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/The_Mainline_Kernel">mainline kernel</a>
        (instead of some outdated Android fork), so we can at least have a safer userspace.
