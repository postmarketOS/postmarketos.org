## Mainline On the Horizon

In February 2017 Jeremy McNicoll did a presentation on his progress on [forward porting Google Nexus 5X/6P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77tuFtM4gjA). He explains the technical difficulties of replacing the downstream Linux kernel that you find on your device after you bought it with the latest [upstream version](https://www.kernel.org/). Towards the end, he comments his "lessons learned" slide with the words: "Maybe 10 years ago I would have said we can cure world hunger, we can get the whole thing working." Then he shaked his head. "I'm more realistic now."

This is how it felt like one and a half years ago. It was hard to imagine that we could have phones that would run the upstream kernel. Which means that every time the vendor's ridiculously short support cycle ends, we would not have a feasible method of patching all the critical security holes in the core of the operating system.

Don't get your hopes up too high, there is still a long way to go. But after all the amazing work done by hackers in communities like ##linux-msm and #freedreno, this is getting realistic now. Besides the progress in postmarketOS, this goal is being adapted by more projects. Two more distributions decided to make mainline Linux on (specific) phones their mission: [Pure OS](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) and [Maemo Leste](https://maemo-leste.github.io/).

Even established vendors seem to be moving in this direction. In March of this year, the [Linaro Connect Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMh4ZmR59hQ) had 15 minutes of convincing its big list of [member companies](https://www.linaro.org/members/) that mainline is the way to go: "Very few embedded [SoCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) are supported properly upstream. That is changing, it has to change. [...] and most importantly, we have to do that upstream. Because nothing else scales. Testing just your own version doesn't actually help everyone else. And as a result you don't get the benefit of everybody else's testing."

## postmarketOS: Experimental Sustainable Operating System
[![](/static/img/2018-05/fbdebug-smte-bars-wrong-thumb.png){: class="fr ml3 mb4"}](/static/img/2018-05/fbdebug-smte-bars-wrong.jpg)

Before we begin with our list of changes since the last post in [December](/blog/2017/12/31/219-days-of-postmarketOS/), here's the usual summary for people new to the project: postmarketOS aims to be a sustainable operating system that empowers users to safely use their devices until they physically break. We divide the system into packages and share them between all devices, with a few device-specific packages as exception. In contrary to having the whole system built device specific (like Android), this makes the system much more maintainable.

At this point, postmarketOS is only meant to be used by developers. In most instances, phone calls, SMS, bluetooth or the mainline kernel won't work on your device, and there's the [firmware problem](https://ollieparanoid.github.io/post/security-warning/).

## Nexus 5: FLOSS Modem Stack With Mainline
[![](/static/img/2018-05/mainline-hammerhead-plamo-firefox-thumb.png){: class="fr ml3 cr"}](/static/img/2018-05/mainline-hammerhead-plamo-firefox.jpg)

You might remember [@bshah](https://github.com/bhush9)'s  photo of the [Nexus 5](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Google_Nexus_5_(lg-hammerhead)) running mainline with a [flipped and distorted screen](/static/img/2017-12/mainline-hammerhead.jpg) from December. [@flto](https://github.com/flto) [continued](https://github.com/flto/linux/wiki/hammerhead-upstream) his work: the display works without problems now. Even better, the touch screen is working, it has 3D acceleration with the open source [freedreno](https://github.com/freedreno/freedreno/wiki) userspace driver, Wi-Fi works, and the best part is that [@MartijnBraam](https://github.com/MartijnBraam) was able to send SMS and initialize a call via command line as well as getting the connectivity signal from the modem through [oFono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oFono) displayed in [Plasma Mobile](https://plasma-mobile.org/) ([#1502](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1502)). All of that without proprietary userspace blobs!

Of course it would be nice if one could accept the call and actually talk to the other end. We're not quite there yet, but thanks to Srinivas Kandagatla who is working on mainline audio support for the [Snapdragon 820 SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Qualcomm_Snapdragon_devices#Snapdragon_820_and_821), the Linux kernel will soon be able to utilize the audio stack on Qualcomm phones like the Nexus 5. Then we can puzzle the userspace functionality together.

So right now we can communicate with the Qualcomm Modem Interface (QMI) without using any userspace blobs. This would not have been possible without the amazing work from [@scintill](https://github.com/scintill) who packaged all necessary glue libraries provided by [@andersson](https://github.com/andersson) ([#1314](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1314)). The first pull request made it work with the downstream kernel of the [Galaxy S4 Mini LTE](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S4_Mini_LTE) followed by another PR that enabled it to work with our mainline packaging ([#1381](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1381)).

## linux-postmarketos-qcom
As we are running bleeding edge technology here, we need to use kernel patches that did not make their way into the mainline kernel yet. These patches are tiny in size, and the patch authors are trying to upstream them (in contrary to kernels from Android with vendor patches in the order of a hundred thousand up to one million lines of changes, as the Linaro keynote mentions). We decided to set up a staging repository [`linux-postmarketos`](https://github.com/postmarketOS/linux-postmarketos) for easy collaboration, and packaging the Qualcomm specific branch from there in a new package `linux-postmarketos-qcom`. With the separate package, the patches won't break anything for non-Qualcomm devices that use an upstream kernel in postmarketOS.

Two more devices besides the Nexus 5 are using `linux-postmarketos-qcom` already. The [Sony Xperia Z2](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Sony_Xperia_Z2_(sony-sirius)) (not to be confused with the [tablet](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Sony_Xperia_Z2_Tablet_(sony-castor-windy))) ported by [@opendata26](https://github.com/opendata26) has battery capacity, temperature sensors, Wi-Fi and the display with 3D accelleration working! More great news: in theory one would need a closed source component to communicate with the cellular modem, but kernel hacker @bamse confirmed that Sony allowed him to release that as open source!

The third device is the [Samsung Galaxy S5](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S5_(samsung-klte)) contributed by [@drebrez](https://github.com/drebrez). It is in an early porting stage, but so far the debug serial interface, volume buttons and internal storage access are working with that kernel. If you want to use the display with postmarketOS, you need to use the downstream kernel (which is packaged as well). Nowadays you can choose the kernel during the installation ([#1363](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1363)).

(TODO: add pictures of those devices)

## Raspberry Pi, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Nokia N9
[![](/static/img/2018-05/raspberry-pi-tv-thumb.png){: class="fr ml3 cr"}](/static/img/2018-05/raspberry-pi-tv.jpg)

Besides Qualcomm devices, we have a hand full of additional new ports running close to mainline. [@drebrez](https://github.com/drebrez) tweaked pmOS to run on all Raspberry Pi models up to 3A, building on the [existing support in Alpine](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) ([#1501](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1501)). [@yangxuan8282](https://github.com/yangxuan8282) did a lot of testing and took this photo of XFCE4 running on a small touch screen directly on the Pi.

Next up is the Tegra based [Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_10.1%22_(samsung-p4wifi)) with an amazing feature list containing Wi-Fi, 2D acceleration, VDPAU h264 hardware decoding, headphone and speaker audio as well as bluetooth! [@Decatf](https://github.com/Decatf) added the device in [#1279](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1279).

Finally the [Nokia N9](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Nokia_N9) work of [@filippz](https://github.com/filippz) and [@pavelmachek](https://github.com/pavelmachek) which we introduced in the [last post](/blog/2017/12/31/219-days-of-postmarketOS/#nokia-n9xx-devices) has been updated and merged into the `master` branch ([#1101](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1101)). [@pavelmachek](https://github.com/pavelmachek) [explained](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1046#issuecomment-354362721) why the N9 and all other devices listed in this section have their own kernel packages instead of using `linux-postmarketos-stable` (like the [Nokia N900](/blog/2017/09/03/100-days-of-postmarketos/#mainline-kernel)): "We'll need quite a few patches for now, and it would be bad to break some other phone with patches relevant for N9. Long-term it is a goal, and we are not that far, but I don't think we should do it now."

<div class="cf"></div>

## Initramfs: Charging and Maximum Attention
postmarketOS is able to show a nice battery loading screen while it is "turned off" and charging, because [@drebrez](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1081) integrated [`charging-sdl`](https://github.com/postmarketOS/charging-sdl) into the [initramfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk) ([#1081](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1081)).

When [porting pmOS to a new device](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Porting_to_a_new_device), it may happen that the device doesn't do anything on first boot. The screen stays dark (or displays the OEM logo) and the USB networking does not come up. In this case we don't even know for sure if the kernel we just tested is booting at all, or if it crashed before even executing the initramfs code. But this information is crucial in order to use the right [troubleshooting techniques](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Troubleshooting:boot). Thanks to [@MayeulC](https://github.com/MayeulC) we can install the `maximum-attention` initramfs hook now, which will flash every LED it can find, as well as running the vibration motor ([#1238](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1238)). Be prepared to see your device wandering across the table!

## New UIs
Just like typical Desktop Linux distributions, postmarketOS is not limited to one user interface. We had [Hildon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildon), [LuneOS UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuneOS), [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org/), [Plasma Mobile](https://plasma-mobile.org/), [Weston](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) and [XFCE4](https://xfce.org/) packaged already. LuneOS UI is currently disabled, because we need to re-integrate it with the latest QT upgrade in Alpine ([#1459](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1459), help wanted). However, two new user interfaces have been contributed.

### i3wm
Tiling window managers like [i3](https://i3wm.org/) make as much use of the screen space as possible. If you have one window open, it is always full screen, two windows split the screen in half and so on. When thinking about this, that is not so different from what today's mainstream smartphone user interfaces do. The similarities end in the fact that you can use the touch screen to manage your windows on the phone, while in a tiling WM you would use the keyboard.

We have found two ways to use i3 on a mobile device. One is obviously using devices with a keyboard, like the Nokia N900. Since i3 is about as resource lightweight as it gets, it is a pretty good match for that classic machine and a few people are using it! The other is extending i3 with touch controls. [@michitux](https://github.com/michitux) has been working on integrating [i3touchmenu](https://github.com/ssmolkin1/i3touchmenu/) [#1343](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1343) as you can see in [this video]() of his Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0.

TODO: actually link to video, add pictures.

### Matchbox
[@duncanguthrie](https://github.com/duncanguthrie) had fun with getting the old school Matchbox window manager to postmarketOS. This is part of his quest of bringing back a PDA like experience, as detailed in the [Handheld](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Handhelds) wiki article he wrote.

## Optional Proprietary Components And Libhybris
We outlined numerous times on this blog that running proprietary blobs comes at the cost of making (security) updates almost impossible as soon as vendors drop their support. Also it gets much harder to check the binaries for backdoors. Then again, countless phones and tablets were produced already. We can be happy if we make a few of them work with a full FLOSS stack, but for most of them this won't happen. So should we throw all of them away? [For the environmental conscious, this is not an option.](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90165365/smartphones-are-wrecking-the-planet-faster-than-anyone-expected)

So we won't have a one size fits all solution that makes everybody happy. Some people [want the full FLOSS stack](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/756#issuecomment-368274455), even if that means Wi-Fi and telephony do not work because of lack of free firmware. Others find proprietary firmware acceptable, but do not wish to run proprietary userspace code. And there are folks who just want to make use of all peripherals of their device, even if it requires blobs in userspace.

[We embrace all of these sides.](/blog/2017/09/03/100-days-of-postmarketos/#why-we-evolve-in-many-directions) What you want to do is up to you, we give you the choice during the installation ([#1254](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1254)):

```shell-session
$ pmbootstrap init
...
Device [qemu-amd64]: example-example
This device has proprietary components, which trade some of your freedom with making more
peripherals work. We would like to offer full functionality without hurting your freedom,
but this is currently not possible for your device.
device-example-example-nonfree-firmware: modem, Wi-Fi, accelerated GPU
Enable this package? (y/n) [y]:
device-example-example-nonfree-userland: accelerated GPU
Enable this package? (y/n) [n]:
```

[@NotKit](https://github.com/NotKit)'s work on packaging [libhybris](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1002) has been integrated ([#1402](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1402)), which is the base for making proprietary userspace drivers from Android work with a non-Android Linux distribution. More streamlining is necessary to actually use this when installing postmarketOS. However he made several demos already, including a port of postmarketOS with libhybris and 3D acceleration running on the [Gemini PDA](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Planet_Computers_Gemini_PDA_(planet-geminipda)).

TODO: add gemini photo (e.g. from that youtube video)

## #postmarketOS-lowlevel: MT6797 BROM Dumped
Speaking of free firmware: our recently established [#postmarketOS-lowlevel](/blog/2018/04/14/lowlevel/) crew is taking baby steps towards liberating bootloaders and cellular modem firmware for MediaTek devices. Around the time of the announcement blog post in April, quite a few people have joined the channel and started contributing. Most notably [@cyrozap](https://github.com/cyrozap) has managed to dump the Boot ROM (BROM) of the MT6797 using [Serial Wire Debug (SWD)](https://www.silabs.com/community/mcu/32-bit/knowledge-base.entry.html/2014/10/21/serial_wire_debugs-qKCT) (similar to [JTAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG)). The method was chosen, because no preloader sources were available for this System on a Chip as [@cyrozap](https://github.com/cyrozap) stated: "If preloader sources for an SoC are available, like they were for the MT6737M-based Orange Pi 4G-IoT, it's a lot easier to dump the BROM from Linux after disabling the BROM/SRAM lockout code in the preloader &mdash; doing that doesn't require any special hardware and most boards don't have the default JTAG/SWD pins exposed anyways."

## pmbootstrap Improvements
As always: a lot of time went into improving our swiss army knife of postmarketOS development, installation and flashing that is [`pmbootstrap`](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap). Let's break it down.

### Continuous Integration: Build Packages And QEMU Test
Whenever someone got their new device port to a point where it boots, the porting guide recommends to make a pull request and upstream it (so everyone can benefit from the work that has been done and build upon it). In order to keep the reviewing efforts as low as possible, [@ollieparanoid](https://github.com/ollieparanoid) implemented the following new CI checks:

* All devices must be [documented in the wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices) ([#1369](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1369))
* All changed packages must build ([#982](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/982))

[#982](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/982) also has a new test case that instructs `pmbootstrap` to do two full installations (one of them with XFCE4, the other one with Plasma Mobile). Both installations will then run in QEMU, and the test case will connect via SSH to the VM to verify the running processes. More than once this saved us from introducing bugs by accident in the installation code.

### Development: Local Source, Newapkbuild And Basic ZSH Completion
Patch development has gotten a lot easier, because now it is possible to replace the source tarball downloaded from the web on the fly with a local source code folder ([#1210](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1210#issuecomment-364590002)). Furthermore we are wrapping [Alpine's `newapkbuild`](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Newapkbuild) to quickly generate standard package build recipies for various build systems with just one shell command ([#894](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/894), [#1320](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1320)).

As a hacker working with `pmbootstrap`, you don't need to keep the growing list of things it can do by now in your head. Instead, there's the `--help` output and the all-new [README.md](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/blob/master/README.md), which is basically a big cheat sheet with lots of example commands. Also you can make use of the rudimentary ZSH autocompletion ([#1232](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1232)). Right now it can do basic stuff like extending `pmbootstrap newa<tab>` to `pmbootstrap newapkbuild`. Help wanted in [#1517](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1517) for a more sophisticated approach!

TODO: add alternative menuconfig UIs PR by steamp0rt

### Installation: Custom Hostname, New Parameters --rsync and --split
We made it possible to set a hostname, with the device's code name being the default ([#1327](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1327)). Wearing down SD cards during multiple installations can be prevented by using `--rsync` to only update what has been changed in the file sytem since the previous installation ([#1151](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1151)). Lastly a new `--split` parameter allows to split the boot and root partitions, instead of combining them to one partition with subpartitions ([#1442](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1442)). This makes the mainlining workflow easier, because the latter method [does not work](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1049) with recently mainlined devices like the Nexus 5 yet.

## Get Involved
### Mainline Your Device!
Mainlining expert [@opendata26](https://github.com/opendata26) encourages our readers to join the effort: "One thing I think we should really highlight is that if they have decent knowledge of Linux and if they have a supported SoC - I would say S4 Pro, Snapdragon 820 (you would want [UART](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Serial_debugging) for that but once it's running most stuff should work), 845 (same as 820, just need tons of patches on [patchwork](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-arm-msm/list/)), 410, 801, 600 and probably S4 (non pro). That they can feel free to join the matrix and that it's very likely we'll end up with a working mainline kernel." Working means in this context anything from "it boots" to having all the features working that we presented above. The latter is a bigger challenge of course.

Hackers ready for this exercise can check out the brand-new [Mainling Guide](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Mainline_Guide) in our wiki. It takes several shortcuts, such as having [one command](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Mainline_Guide#envkernel.sh) that exports the right environment variables for your device and sets up a known working Alpine Linux chroot with all required packages for cross compiling the kernel ([#1424](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1424)). Without touching your host system. The [mentors]() listed in the guide can help you to create your device tree source file, which tells the kernel the location and parameters of all the peripherals in your little mobile computer. Because these peripherals are used over and over again in different devices, oftentimes we can just enable them without writing new drivers!

### More Ways to Help Out
We have a ton of [quests ready to be picked up](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20). Wheather it's simply helping out other people with thinking through how they could debug issues on their devices, fixing bugs, implementing cool new features towards the goal of having postmarketOS usable on a daily driver level or straight up [hacking everything without fear](https://drewdevault.com/2018/03/17/Hack-everything-without-fear.html): there is a lot to learn and a lot of fun to have!

Specific examples:

* [Port your phone](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Porting_to_a_new_device)
* [Install pmOS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Installation_guide) on your machines if there's already a port
* Make [good photos/videos](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Making_good_photos) of devices running pmOS for the [wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Special:ListFiles) and [/r/postmarketOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/postmarketOS/)
* [#1286](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1286): packaging [Anbox](https://anbox.io/), and experimental project that runs Android apps on regular Linux distributions. After some patching we have it compiling and showing the "Starting..." screen, but the way it configures LXC does not work out of the box for us. To move forward, one could install Anbox on Ubuntu (where it is officially supported) and add debug code to Anbox and LXC to figure out what it does differently there.
* [#592](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/592): integrating [nexmon](https://nexmon.org) so we can patch security holes in abandoned Wi-Fi firmware.
* [#62](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/62) Improve or package your favorite user interface.
* [Testing and/or reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pulls)

If your passion is writing text instead of code: we could use some help with these blog posts. It boils down to going through the [closed pull requests](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and photos posted in the [chatroom](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Matrix_and_IRC), categorizing them into logical sections before writing one paragraph after another and adding images to round it up. Contributing to any step of that process would be greatly appreciated and saves us a lot of time that we could put in other areas of the project. Get in touch with us in the [postmarketOS.org issues](https://github.com/postmarketOS/postmarketos.org/issues). Another good place to exercise your writing skills to help out pmOS would be [the wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org).
